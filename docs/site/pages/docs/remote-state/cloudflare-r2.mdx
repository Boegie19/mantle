# Cloudflare R2 Remote State

Cloudflare R2 is an S3-compatible object storage service. You can configure Mantle's S3 provider to
use Cloudflare R2.

## Create an account

Create a Cloudflare account from their [sign up page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).

## Create an R2 bucket

From the Cloudflare console, select R2 from the sidebar and click "Create bucket." Give your bucket a name
like `{your-name}-mantle-states`. By default, access is restricted so only you can access your data.

Click "Create bucket" to finish creating your bucket.

## Upload your existing state file

If you are migrating an existing project from local state files to remote, you will need to upload
your state file to your bucket.

Before you do so though you need to pick your project name which will be used for the name of the
state file in your bucket and in your Mantle configuration in the next step.

Rename your local state file to `{project-name}.mantle-state.yml`, then upload it to your bucket. From the
Cloudflare bucket console, drag and drop your state file or open the file picker to upload your file.

## Configure your Mantle project

Head back to your Mantle config file and add the `state` configuration:

```yaml filename="mantle.yml"
# ...your existing configuration
state:
  remote:
    region:
      custom:
        name: <r2-region-name>
        endpoint: <r2-s3-api>
    bucket: <bucket-name>
    key: <project-name>
```

- Replace `<r2-region-name>` with the region your bucket was created in. This will generally be the closest
  region to yourself or the region you specified during creation. Check the [R2
  docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/data-location/#available-hints) for the full list of
  possible regions.
- Replace `<r2-s3-api>` with the API endpoint for your bucket. You can find this in your bucket's settings tab
  under the "Bucket Details" section.
- Replace `<bucket-name>` with the name you selected when you created your bucket.
- Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your project. This will be used to name the state file
  in your bucket. For example, if you supply `pirate-wars` it will create a
  `pirate-wars.mantle-state.yml` file in your bucket.

## Supply your R2 credentials

At this point if you were to run `mantle deploy` it would attempt to download your state file from
R2 but it would fail because you have not provided any authorization for your bucket.

To get your credentials, go to the R2 Overview page on Cloudflare, and navigate to "Manage R2 API Tokens".
Create a new token with the "Object Read & Write" permissions and apply it to your bucket. Once created, you
will see a couple of secrets. You'll need to use the "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access Key" for Mantle.

To learn how to pass these credentials to Mantle, read the
[Authentication](/docs/authentication#remote-state-management) guide.

Once supplied, you can run `mantle deploy` or any other commands and they will operate on your
remote state file! If you were migrating from local state to remote state, you should delete the
`.mantle-state.yml` file from your Git repo as it will be unused and out of date.
