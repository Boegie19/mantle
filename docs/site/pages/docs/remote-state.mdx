# Remote State

Mantle saves the state of your resources in state files which enables it to make only the required
changes to your resources after your configuration and files change.

By default, Mantle will save your state to a local `.mantle-state.yml` file which you can check-in
to your Git repo. But Mantle can also save your state to remote files stored in a cloud provider
which comes with a few benefits.

Since a remote state file can be accessed and updated from anywhere, you can share it across
branches and computers. This makes it less likely your state files gets out of sync with the real
resources in Roblox, and it is ideal for continuous deployment (CD) scenarios.
